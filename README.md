# Help Me!
A website for the fictitious HelpMe!-Project.
It is meant to serve as a digital point of first contact with potential patients as well as people who are interested in volunteering their time and provide the basic information, like: the addresses of the two clinics

### Logo and Form menu exeption (Logo + Back to hompage promt):
> The side wide Loge (HelpMe!) also contains an anchor linking it back to the top of the hompage.</br>
I made the decission to not include the navigation menu on the Form page because it looked cluttered and unnessesary.</br>
Instead I basicaly expanded the Logo to include a reminder that it brings the user back to the Home page.

### Footer:
